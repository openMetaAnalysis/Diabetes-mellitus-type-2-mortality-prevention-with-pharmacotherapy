Diabetes mellitus type 2 mortality prevention with pharmacotherapy
============================================
A living systematic review with [arrows plot](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/arrows_plot)

Short url: http://openMetaAnalysis.github.io/Diabetes-mellitus-type-2-mortality-prevention-with-pharmacotherapy

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is not* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I2 was '[moderate](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 64%. This review updates the previously published meta-analysis.(1)

Mortality reduction *is* shown in the subgroups of trials that used sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Acknowledgement: we acknowledge the essential work by the authors of the prior systematic review(s) listed below.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that combines methods of scoping, rapid, and living systematic reviews.  This analysis updates one or more previously published review(s).(1) A comparison of studies include in this review compared to prior reviews are in the table, [reconciliation of trials included with prior meta-analyses/](files/reconciliation-tables/Reconciliation%20of%20studies.pdf). Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the:
